abstract: |
    The 42 text files have been successfully grouped into 6 different topics. These topics are somewhat related as the analysis below will demonstrate. Folder names have been suggested for each of the topic folders in which the files have been allocated to. There is significant opportunity to extend this sort of analysis into other business areas while understanding our own organisational culture more thoroughly. This can assist in reducing risk and identifying friction points ahead of time.
